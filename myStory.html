										<h1>My Story</h1>
									</header>
									<p>
										Robotics was once a distant dream for me.
										<br><br>
										Born in a medical doctor&rsquo;s family in China, I had been told by my parents since childhood to follow in their footsteps and become a doctor like them. During high school, I engaged in a hospital-based research project. However, during this time, I had the opportunity to observe the routines of doctors closely and soon realized that I didn't have a true passion for the career. Upon admission to WPI, I still enrolled on a pre-med track, not due to a desire to become a doctor, but rather because, all my skills and knowledge were oriented toward a medical career then, and I had yet to encounter an alternative that truly ignited my passion.
										<br><br>
										The turning point came when I took an elective in Robotics my sophomore year. The first topic of the course was differential drive, and the concept of odometry fascinated me. I was amazed by how simple math equations can determine robot&rsquo;s movement. Before this course, math often seemed disconnected from practical applications. Yet, as I dived into robotics, I developed a growing understanding of mathematical concepts. Robotics enabled me to interpret math equations and employ them to describe real-world phenomena.
										<br><br>
										Despite the fact that I was confident about the concepts, I lacked practical skills. Unlike most of my peers at WPI, who had experience in Robotics since high school, I've never had the opportunity to write a program, wire a circuit, or even use a screwdriver. To master the basics and bridge the gap in skills and knowledge, I made it a daily habit to visit the lab and seek guidance from Student Assistants. These were senior Robotics students with remarkable expertise, whom I greatly admired as they guided me to master robotics from the ground up. 
										<br><br>
										With two years of dedicated effort, I completed all five core robotics courses at WPI. Furthermore, in the last course, I led my team to achieve the second position in completing the group project, outperforming many of my peers with much more prior expertise in robotics than me. At the end of my junior year, I applied for a Student Assistantship in the Robotics department. Not only do I consider this an honor to acknowledge my growth, but I also aspire to seize this opportunity to assist those who have yet to gain exposure to robotics to learn and enjoy robotics, just as the Student Assistants once aided me. 
										<br><br>
										After three months, I received the offer to the role I had long aspired to. Suddenly, I was relieved. I used to worry that I might never excel in robotics since such talented people had started their careers early and seemed always ahead of me. However, upon receiving the offer, I came to an understanding that the key to success in a field is not necessarily having an early and innate passion for it; it is perfectly fine to discover a true devotion later in life and pursue it with determination.
